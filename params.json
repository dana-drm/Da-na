The challenge of effectively capitalizing on these connections to raise more funds decreases transparency. As a result, donors feel like their donations enter a black box, as they cannot track the impact of their donations.\r\n\r\nDāna lets NGOs match the donors to the specific beneficiaries and projects they supported. Dividing these projects into stages, we are able to track the completion of each component. Once a stage is completed, the NGO, now, has the tools to update its donors in a very personal and customized manner.\r\n\r\nWe are piloting our platform with Palestine Children’s Relief Fund which helps children from Middle East’s under- resourced communities to seek medical treatment in developed countries. In order to connect 800+ beneficiaries and 100+ projects with 6000+ donors, PCRF will use our automated yet customizable tool to manage these relations more time-efficiently. \r\n\r\n[Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1ckCpEoKKVGeTZLYWZmTV9vX1E/view?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nTEAM\r\n\r\n*Arushi Jain\r\n*Belce Dogru\r\n*Bronson Duran\r\n*Nathan Eidelsen\r\n\r\n\r\n",
