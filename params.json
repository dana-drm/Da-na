The challenge of effectively capitalizing on these connections to raise more funds decreases transparency. As a result, donors feel like their donations enter a black box, as they cannot track the impact of their donations.\r\n\r\nDāna lets NGOs match the donors to the specific beneficiaries and projects they supported. Dividing these projects into stages, we are able to track the completion of each component. Once a stage is completed, the NGO, now, has the tools to update its donors in a very personal and customized manner.\r\n\r\nWe are piloting our platform with Palestine Children’s Relief Fund which helps children from Middle East’s under- resourced communities to seek medical treatment in developed countries. In order to connect 800+ beneficiaries and 100+ projects with 6000+ donors, PCRF will use our automated yet customizable tool to manage these relations more time-efficiently. \r\n\r\n[Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1ckCpEoKKVGeTZLYWZmTV9vX1E/view?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nTEAM\r\n\r\n* Arushi Jain @arushijain\r\n* Belce Dogru\r\n* Bronson Duran @bronsduran\r\n* Nathan Eidelson @nathaneidelson\r\n\r\nRESEARCH \r\n\r\nWe're developing a prototype that's aimed at helping donors donate more habitually to impactful charities. \r\n\r\nThrough our user research, we found three main reasons why donors donate repeatedly to an organization.\r\n    \r\n     1) The donor believes that his/her donation actually made a difference. (Impact tracking)\r\n     2) The donor's emotions are evoked through the donation process . (Donor/Beneficiary connection fostering)\r\n     3) The donor's friends are donating to the organization. (Social network leveraging)\r\n\r\nWe have observed that donation platforms like [Watsi](http://watsi.org) or [Kiva](http://kiva.org)  have a project-based approach to fundraising. So the donor gets to create an emotional link with the beneficiary. Watsi is especially successful at sustaining this bond by sending updates to the donor about the improvements in the beneficiary's state. For example, after the surgery is done, the donor gets an email about how it went, or after the patient has recovered fully, the donor gets notified. This approach seems to increase donations for the NGO significantly; however, currently there seems to be barriers for NGOs to adopt an update-system such as this one. The NGOs that we talked with during our research phase mentioned that producing content of communication similar to what Watsi is doing (with photos and an email) takes too much time and requires additional labor/technical skills. \r\n\r\nOur team is building a tool that is very easy to use. The platform lets the NGO import its \"contacts list\" of donors and beneficiaries/project details (how much money was needed, how long it is expected to take, etc.) and turns it into update emails based on the stage of completion and automatically customizes the emails to address each donor. Then you can send these emails to all of your donors/or the ones that you choose with the click of a button to let them know what their money is being spent on. In doing so, the NGO is able to provide donors with richer data on where/how their money is being spent, which in turn will lead donors to donate more often.\r\n\r\nFor more details, check out a 17 page report we put together in Winter 2015 - [Project Research Document ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3sHFoDiwIB0SG1qd3A2Q2l0Q0dmN0ZUdDNKYXg1UW1CN2Zz/view?usp=sharing)",
