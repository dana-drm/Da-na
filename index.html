<p>NGOs operating internationally manage complex projects that involve multiple donors, projects and beneficiaries. The challenge of effectively capitalizing on these connections to raise more funds decreases transparency. As a result, donors feel like their donations enter a black box, as they cannot track the impact of their donations.</p>

<p>Dāna lets NGOs match the donors to the specific beneficiaries and projects they supported. Dividing these projects into stages, we are able to track the completion of each component. Once a stage is completed, the NGO, now, has the tools to update its donors in a very personal and customized manner.</p>

<p>We are piloting our platform with Palestine Children’s Relief Fund which helps children from Middle East’s under- resourced communities to seek medical treatment in developed countries. In order to connect 800+ beneficiaries and 100+ projects with 6000+ donors, PCRF will use our automated yet customizable tool to manage these relations more time-efficiently. </p>
